# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alexis, a Front-End Developer passionate about bridging the gap between development and design.

Currently focusing on:

- Design Systems
- DesignOps
- Developer-Designer collaboration
- Front-end Architecture

My projects here might be a bit outdated (life happens! ðŸ˜…), but they reflect my journey in tech.

I'm constantly learning and exploring new ways to improve the synergy between technical implementation and design excellence.
